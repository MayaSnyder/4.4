Our website is for a company called Chris and Donnie Farrier Service. Their business includes putting a new set of horseshoes on horses, and maintaining them. On the site, you will find a brief history about the company and its owners, how to contact them, why you should choose them, their prices, and two videos.

Our web page design consists of a light grey background that fades into a darker grey as you reach the bottom. The title font is Pattaya and the color is a bright blue with the content font being Cormorant Infant with the color of white. There are also some white details on the titles. The tabs have a white font and a blue border. We decided on those fonts and colors based on what represented the company best and what looks professional, but also pleasing to the eye. We chose this company to be our client because we felt like it was a unique topic and we both have a love for horses.  

We would like to thank Dev Catalyst for allowing us to be a part of this competition. It was such an amazing experience to create a web page that embodies our newfound talent and our ingenuity. We hope that you enjoy viewing our website as much as we were delighted in constructing it.
